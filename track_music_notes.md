As a user
So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.

verbs = [keep,add,track,listened,see]
nouns = [user,music,list]





# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._

## 2. Design the Class Interface

_Include the initializer, public properties, and public methods with all parameters, return values, and side-effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE

class music_tracker:

    def __init__(self):
        # blank list to hold the music
        self.list = []


    def add_music(self,list, track):
        #function to add tracks, appends to list
        pass

    def see_tracks(self,track):
        pass 
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

``` python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a name and a task
#remind reminds the user to do the task
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

"""
Given a name and no task
#remind raises an exception
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # raises an error with the message "No task set."

"""
Given a name and an empty task
#remind still reminds the user to do the task, even though it looks odd
"""
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
